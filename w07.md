# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. ***[Process Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)***

   Process Synchronization means sharing system resources by processes in a such a way that, Concurrent access to shared data is handled thereby minimizing the chance of inconsistent data. Maintaining data consistency demands mechanisms to ensure synchronized execution of cooperating processes. Process Synchronization was introduced to handle problems that arose while multiple process are executed.

2. ***[Critical Section Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)***

   A Critical Section is a code segment that accesses shared variables and has to be executed as an atomic action. It means that in a group of cooperating processes, at a given point of time, only one process must be executing its critical section. If any other process also wants to execute its critical section, it must wait until the first one finishes.

3. ***[Mutex Locks](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)***

   As the synchronization hardware solution is not easy to implement for everyone, a strict software approach called Mutex Locks was introduced. In this approach, in the entry section of code, a LOCK is acquired over the critical resources modified and used inside critical section, and in the exit section that LOCK is released. As the resource is locked while a process executes its critical section hence no other process can access it.
