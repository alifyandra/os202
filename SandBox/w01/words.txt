When a device is being emulated, a software-based construct has replaced a hardware component. With emulation, since an entire machine can be created as a virtual construct, there are a wider variety of opportunities, but with the aforementioned emulation penalty. But, emulation makes it possible to, for example, run programs designed for a completely different architecture on an x86 PC. With virtualization, the virtual machine uses hardware directly, although there is an overarching scheduler. As such, no emulation is taking place, but this limits what can be run inside virtual machines to operating systems that could otherwise run atop the underlying hardware. That said, this method provides the best overall performance of the two solutions.
