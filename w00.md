# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. **Why we need an OS**

    An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer hardware. It provides an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient manner.
    
2. **Functionality of an OS**

    Manage a computer's resources, establish a user interface, and execute and provide services for application software.

3. **OS Design Issues**

    Flexibility: Designs that have been motivated to allow system to be tailored to specific apps.

    Reliability: The range of quality among operating systems.

    Performance: The rate that software improves is slower compared to hardware.

    Security: Confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

4. **Networked and single user OS's**

    Networked, client-server, distributed OS's can communicate through a network of nodes or clients while a single user OS is just a single computer with only one OS that is operated by a single person.

5. **Security threats to an OS**

    - Breach of confidentiality

    - Breach of integrity

    - Breach of availability

    - Theft of Service

    - Denial of Service (DOS)

      

6. **Logical Layer of an OS**

    Provides high level functions, like file management, internet and networking facilities, etc

7. **Application Programming Interface (API)**

    An API is a specified set of functions that are available to a programmer that includes the parameters passed to each function and the return values to expect. In the context of an OS, a programmer accesses an API via a library of code provided by the operating system.

8. **Resource Management on an OS**

    An OS is essentially system software that manages computer hardware & software resources to be used for computer programs. How an OS does this is through CPU scheduling, the method of assigning work to resources that compete the work.

9. **Contrasting Kernel and User Mode**

    These are 2 modes of operation in an operating system, the system is in user mode when the operating system is running a user application such as handling a text editor. The transition from user to kernel mode occurs when an application requests the helo of the OS or an interrupt or system call occurs. The kernel mode is a mode used when some privileged instructions need to be executed such as interrupt instructions or I/O management etc.

10. **Structuring Methods of an OS**

    A simple structure is a well defined small structure where interfaces and levels of functionality are not well separated like MS-DOS. A layered structure breaks down the OS into a number of layers that are designed where each layer uses the functions of the lower level layers only.  A micro-kernel structure removes all non-essential components from the kernel and implements them as system and user programs. Lastly a modular structure is considered the best because the kernel only has a set of core components and other services are added as dynamically loaded modules to the kernel either during run time or boot time.
