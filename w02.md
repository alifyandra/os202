# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. **Security and Protection in an OS**

   Security is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and
   
   its data will be preserved. Meanwhile protection is the set of mechanisms that control the access of processes and users to the resources defined by a computer system. 
   
2. **Threats to an OS**

   There are many different types of threats that an OS is vulnerable to. 

   - <u>Malware</u>: Any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network.
   - <u>Trojan</u>: A type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software.
   - <u>Logic Bomb</u>: A piece of codeintentionally inserted into a softwaresystem that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met.
   - <u>Worm</u>:  A standalone malwarecomputer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.

3. **Security Violation Methods**

   There are a variety of methods to violate a computers security

   - <u>Masquerading</u>: An attack that uses a fake identity, such as a network identity, to gain unauthorized access to personal computer information through legitimate access identification. 
   - <u>Replay Attack</u>: A replay attack (also known as playback attack) is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed.
   - <u>Man-in-the-middle</u>: An attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other

4. **Script Kiddies**

   Script kiddie is a slang commonly used in the hacker community for people with minimal knowledge of computers or hacking who use use pre built hacking software and establish themselves as hackers. They often will use these programs without even knowing how they work or what they do. This hacker etymology was pretty funny and interesting to me as a video about the origins of this word popped up in my youtube reccomendations which I then watched and *tada!*, it turns out this topic appeared in the week 2 OS course slide.

5. **Cryptography**

   Cryptography in its definition means secret writing, in practice we can define cryptography as the act of concealing or protecting data so it can only be read by certain people. In computer science and operating systems its usually associated with encryption. Encryption is the process of taking plain text, like a text message or email, and scrambling it into an unreadable format called â€œcipher text". 

   Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys, which may be disseminated widely, and private keys, which are known only to the owner. The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems to produce one-way functions

6. **User Authentication**
