# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. ***[What is Concurrency?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)***

   Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel. The running process threads always communicate with each other through shared memory or message passing. Concurrency results in sharing of resources result in problems like deadlocks and resources starvation.

2. ***[Problems of Concurrency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)***

   - Running of Multiple Apps: Enables the running of multiple Apps.
   - Better Resource Utilization: It enables unused resources to be used by other apps.
   - Better Average Response Time: Apps have to wait for each other without concurrency.
   - Better Performance: Enables a better performance by the OS.

3. ***[Drawbacks of Concurrency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)***

   - Non-atomic Operations: Non-atomic operations that are interrupted by processes.
   - Starvation: When a process doesn't obtain service to progress.
   - Deadlock: Two processes are blocked.

4. ***[Fork() in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)***

   Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called a *child process*, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call. A child process uses the same pc(program counter), same CPU registers, same open files which use in the parent process.
